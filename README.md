Mumble Scripts
==============

Mumble scripts is a place for gathering various scripts written for the
Mumble VoIP application.

Mumble script isn't limited to specific languages or use-cases. If you have a
neat, self-contained, script you think might be useful to the community and you
are not bothered by being poked by people if it breaks feel free to create a pull
request.

If you notice anything wrong with the existing scripts please report a bug
using the github issue tracker at https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-scripts/issues .
Of course we also take patches.
